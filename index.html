            I am feeling energetic because of a chai that I had purchased at some point, I've decided to begin this glorious archive of all creation,<br>
       
            in hopes that it might become something absolutely profound one day. No, I have no concern for spelling at all. Here's to the process lmaoooo<br>
        
            <p><b>just need to figure out how to upload files.</b></p>

            There is.. so much time to work with. Why can't I take action? I do happen to have plans for something.<br>
            I am stuck between multiple projects but awaiting for my mortal vessel to cooperate. I think I want to make a video.<br>
            well, it's already been filmed but i am procrastinating putting it together. I am also debating what song to put over it.<br>
